# Milestone 0: Project skeleton

[← all milestones](../plan.md)

Goal:

- establish the module boundaries, config plumbing, and test seams before UI and API work

Deliverables:

- crate structure with the modules above
- minimal app state type
- config loader for TOML
- input action enum and keymap parser
- fake Asana client for tests
- basic error type

Acceptance criteria:

- the project builds
- config can be parsed from TOML
- app state can be instantiated with a fake backend
- unit tests cover basic config and state setup
